Platform threads (or the normal threads) are resource costly (the cost is generally 1-2 mb for such threads) but there is concept of virtualization .

these virtual threads can be kept in ready state and mounted over Platform threads , The platform threads are already created and
the number of platform thread is equal to number of core the machine has .

so in case of virtual threads are blocked then , already existing unmounted threads can utilise the platform threads .
