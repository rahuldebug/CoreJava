Abstraction is a way to hide the actual implementation and functionality .
In java this can be achieved by abstract class and interface .

Abstraction lays down focus on what is being done , rather than how it is done .

Type of methods: Interface can have only abstract methods. Whereas, an abstract class can have abstract method
and concrete methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. From Java 9,
it can have private concrete methods as well.
