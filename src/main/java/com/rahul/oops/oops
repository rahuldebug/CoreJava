Abstraction is a way to hide the actual implementation and functionality .
In java this can be achieved by abstract class and interface .

Abstraction lays down focus on what is being done , rather than how it is done .

Type of methods: Interface can have only abstract methods. Whereas, an abstract class can have abstract method
and concrete methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. From Java 9,
it can have private concrete methods as well.


Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. The interface has only static and final variables.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated .


Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
It is the mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates.
Another way to think about encapsulation is that it is a protective shield
that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield

Polymorphism are of two types ,
compile time (early binding)
runtime or dynamic dispatch or late binding
